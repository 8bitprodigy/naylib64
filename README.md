# Naylib64

A Nim wrapper around [raylib4Nintendo64](https://github.com/raylib4Consoles/raylib4Nintendo64) generated using [futhark](https://github.com/PMunch/futhark). This project is not based on [naylib](https://github.com/planetis-m/naylib), but if you're looking for a Nim wrapper for raylib for PC, I recommend it.
